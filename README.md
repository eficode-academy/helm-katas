## How to Read Exercise Files

All exercise files start with an introduction
followed by the actual exercise.

A general overview of the exercise is given first,
followed by more detailed step-by-step
instructions. If you want a little challenge, you
can try to read the general steps of the
exercise and do the exercise, if you need more help, take a look at
the step-by-step instructions. The step-by-step instructions also explain _why_
some of the steps are done in the way they are in the exercise.

**Each exercise is summarized in bold text at the
beginning.**

- All exercise steps are bulleted. The bulleted
  points summarize the previous paragraphs as
  small individual tasks. **To finish the
  exercise, it's sufficient to read only the
  bulleted steps.** All other text is just
  narrative and explanations as to why things are
  done the way they are.

> Quoted blocks indicate points that are "nice to know" and
> can be safely ignored. They won't affect the
> outcome of the exercise, but generally include
> additional information the training doesn't
> handle.
>
> :bulb: If a quoted paragraph begins with a
> lightbulb, it indicates that it's a hint for the
> exercise step.
